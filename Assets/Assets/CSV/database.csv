42,Soil Profile,"A vertical section of the soil from the ground surface downwards to where the soil meets the underlying rock. A typical profile consists of six layers also called soil horizons. With depth the horizons differ in color, texture, structure and biological activity. Six layers are; O - surface litter or organic matter; A - top soil; E - zones of leaching; B - subsoil; C - parent material; and R - bedrock."
43,Dredged sand,"It is collected from the sea base, it is rich in fresh and broken sea shells, few converted into sand sized particles. Dredged sand is highly rich in calcium carbonates and salts. Scientists consider these sea shells as a way of carbon sequestration by the sea."

49,Gray sand,Greenisg grey colored sand occurs in the vicinity of the crusheres where dark colored rocks (for example) gabro is crushed for construction purpose. Over time the wind borne sand is mixed to to convert greenish grey color to lighter colored grey sand.
50,Anhydritic Aquisalids,"A very first discovery of anhydrite soil in the world. It was discovered in the coastal land of Abu Dhabi emirate at ""Al Dhabaya"". In 2014 United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service has formally added into US Keys to Soil Taxonomy. With this addition globally subsurface diagnostic horizons are increased to 20. A new subsurface diagnostic horizon ""Anhydritic"" has been added. With the addition of Anhydritic mineralogy class globally the numbers are increased to 33."
51,Typic Torriorthents Fragmental,This soil occurs in the Fujaira emirate in Wadis where mountains are dominant landscape features. It provides gravels as construction material.
52,Typic Calcigypsids,"The soil is rich in calcium carbonates (CaCO3) and gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) and can provide both minerals for various uses, like uses in cement factories, as construction material and to amend sodium affected ""sodic"" soils found in agricultural field irrigated with saline water."
53,Lithic Torripsamments,"The cemented calcareous sand ""lithic"" layer is common in the United Arab Emirates found as surface and subsurface deposits. The lithified layer is commonly used as a base to construct highways and construction material. Such soils are not recommended for agriculture uses due to shallow soil."
54,Typic Torripsamments,"The basis of all civilized life, Agricultureallows working the land/soils for food production. Sandy soils ""typic torripsamments"" are dominant in the United Arab Emirates and are used for agriculture purpose. The sandy soils are low in fertility due to either absence or low quantities of organic matter and clay contents. These soils needs special attention for profitable agriculture."
55,Soil health improved with amendments,"The health of poor sandy soil can be improved by the addition of organic and inorganic materials. In the UAE compost, biochar, zeoplant, Austrablend soil conditioner, and bentonite are commonly used to improve rootzone quality in terms of water and nutrient holding capacities."
56,Amended soil improves productivity,"Once soil health is improved by using organic and inorganic amendments, crop yied ""food production"" can be increased, especially barley forage production can be doubled as livestock feed that reduces our dependence on forage import and saves foreigh exchange."
57,Typic Torriorthents,"Climate is one of many different factors that come together to create soil. Many million years ago in glaciation era ice melting caused floods that brought alluvium (gravels) in the wadis, then climate changed to dry period that brought wind born material ""sand"" deposited over the alluvium, current climate is pushing us towards global warming and dry periods which encourage deposition of sand as surface cover, that is the way how soil formation is affected by climate change."
58,Leptic Haplogypsids,"Many coastal lands were once under the sea, the sea shrunk and the land under the sea become coastal land, and the sea has left soil rich in mineral like gypsum and salts. This soil rich in gypsum is one example showing the change in climate has developed soil from the sea."
59,Typic Aquisalids,Current pattern of climate change is raising the temperature that will ultimately melt the arctic sea and cause sea level rise. The sea level rise will inundate the coastal lands and alse sea water intrusion will increase salts in inland soils and the soils will be more saline.
60,Typic Torripsamments,"Loose sandy soils are highly vulnerable to wind erosion causing dust storms, removing healthy soils and encroaching highways and water reservoirs. Globally 24 billion tons of soil is lost just due to erosion. About 75% of the UAE landscapes are covered by sand dunes or sandy surface and are susceptible to wind erosion. The climate change and rising temperature will make the lands drier and susceptible to wind erosion and loss of biodiversity."
61,Typic Haplosalids,Soil and water salinity is threatening the ecosystem of United Arab Emirates. Many agricultural farms are either abandoned due to salinity or their yield has been significantly retarded. We must understand the dynamics of salinization to take appropriate actions to alleviate salinity problem to enhance crop production and to revive abandoned farms.
62,Typic Haplocalcids,"Due to many factors including decline in crop yields from agricultural farms many peoples are migrating to urban areas and thus urbanization is increasing to an unpresidental level. The construction of houses, opening new industries are creating solidwaste which is dumped as landfill. This is serious threat to periurban lands which are diminishing very fast."
63,Sand Dunes Simulation,A sand dune simulator shows how the sand moves in the desert environment to form dust storms and develop different shapes of sand dunes.
64,Anhydrite,Anhydrite (CaSO4) is common mineral in the coastal lands of UAE. Once properly mined and processed to remove impurities it can be used in many ways.
65,Halite,"Halite (NaCl) is dominant mineral in the coastal land of UAE. It is developed through sea water intrusion and subsequent evaporation. There exists a very high potential for mining halite for use in food, chemical industries and even for deicing in Europe. This seems to be a neglected resource in UAE."
66,Gypsum,"Gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) is the third mineral found in the deserts of the UAE. Huge deposits exist which can be exploited for number of uses, especially as construction material and to amend sodium affected soils in agricultural fields."
67,Soil Texture,"Percent distribution of sand, silt and clay in a soil is called soil texture. Equal distribution of sand, silt and clay in a soil is called loamy soil."
68,Colors of UAE Soils,"Deserts of the United Arab Emirates are decorated with diversified colors of sand of various composition, iron rich (red), calcium carbonates rich (white), gabro (greenish grey). Scientifically soil color can be measured by determining three parameters, Hue(a measure of the chromatic composition of light that reaches the eye);Value- indicates the degree of lightness or darkness of a color in relation to a neutral grey color;Chroma- relative purity or strength of the spectra color. Once soil color is reported using Munsell color system, globally everybody undersands about the type of soil and can also trace soil formation history."
69,Practicle Sizes and Soil Texture Classes,"Soil texture depends on the percent distribution of three groups of soil particles based on their sizes: sand (2000-50 µm), silt (50-2 µm) and clay (< 2 µm). Soil texture can be determined using a textural triangle presenting 12 classes. Sandy soils have high infiltration but poor nutrient retention, thus require frequent water and fertilizer application. Silty soils have moderate infiltration and nutrient retention. High silt can clog the soil. Clay soils have low infiltration but high nutrient retention. Equal distribution of sand, silt and clay is called loamy soil."
70,Soil Structure Classes,"Human body is made up of different parts like organs and bones, the soil has its own body ""soil structure"" composed of little clumps known as ""aggregates"" and pores (space between soil particles). Soil particles stuck to each other using organic matter as glue to bind them together into different sizes and shapes like, granular (rounded), blocky (angular and sub angular), prismatic, columnar, massive and loose sand (structure less). A good structured soil is essential for agriculture activities."
71,Low Quality Sandy Soil,"Native sandy soil is low in fertility, such as it has low clay and organic matter contents. It is also not leveled. It does not have the capacity to hold water and nutrients and thus considered low quality soil for crop production. These soils are irrigated and fertilized frequently to offset water and nutrient requirement of crops and thus production become uneconomical."
72,"Amendments and Fertilizers (A)
 
 Sustainable farming (B)","Amendments and Fertilizers (A).Native sandy soils require their health to be improved for crop production. Soil health can be improved by using organic (compost, biochar, biofertilizers) and inorganic (Zeoplant, Austrablend Multi Mineral Soil Conditioner, Zeolite, Bentonite etc) amendments, whereas nutrient status (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium) can be improved by using chemical fertilizers like Urea, Diammonium phosphates, potassium sulfates etc.Sustainable farming (B).The desert landscapes are covered by sand dunes of various heights. These sand dunes are leveled to develp agriculture farms. Initially these farms are not fertile due to lack of clay and organic matter and hence give low crop yield. However, if these soils are amended with combination of organic and inorganic materials and fertilizers their quality can be significantly improved. Research at ICBA has shown that using these amendments barley forage can be doubled."
73,Global Warming and Drylands,Global warmingis a term for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects.Global warming has many effects but most important is that world’s lands once most productive will be converted to drylands and will not be capable of producing crops. Currently drylands occupy 41% of the earth’s terrestrial surface and are home to more than a third of the world’s population.
74,Mineral Resources of Coastal Lands 1,"The coasts of the United Arab Emirates are rich in salt-resources which can be exploited for commercial purpose. One of these salts is Sodium Chloride (NaCl) called halite. Halite has many uses like it can be used as table salt in foods, to make caustic soda, deicing roads when roads are full of snow like Europe."
75,Mineral Resources of Coastal Lands 2,"The other important salt is anhydrite (CaSO4) which can be used to produce sulfuric acid, reclamation of sodium affected soils and making plasters for dressing patients in hospitals."
76,Mineral Resources of Coastal Lands 3,"Gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) is another mineral which has many uses, like it is commonly used as construction material, setting cement, and to amend sodium affected soils."
77,Gypsum Formed in Many Shapes,"Gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) occurs in many shapes in the deserts of the United Arab Emirates. It has commonly been found as lenses, euhedral crystals and desert roses. Desert rose is rosette of gypsum crystals with sand inclusions. These are formed when water rich in calcium and sulfate evaporates under arid sandy conditions like in the salt-scalds “called sabkha” in the UAE. Sand grains are trapped in the gypsum crystals during their growth and give them the same color as the sand."
78,Soils and Rocks Forming Minerals,"Soils are formed from the parent material consisting of various minerals. The composition of soils mainly depends on minerals these soils are formed. These minerals based on their composition can be grouped into various categories, like silicates, alumino-silicates, carbonates, sulfates etc."
79,Desert Carving and Fossels,"Fossils are evidence of ancient life forms or ancient habitats which have been preserved by natural processes. In the United Arab Emirates deserts we come across with several fossilized eggs and footprint of sea shells. The fossilized eggs are mostly rounded and broken on the outside and carved due to climatic effects. However, the types of fossilized eggs are still to be determined."
80,Soils-Pottery and Civilization,"As an art of building objects from soil, Potteryis considered as fundament of civilization, creating the means for long-term storage of food and materials and their protection. The first kind of pottery discovered was earthenware, dating back some 9,000 years. Earthenware pottery is extremely durable and remains in wide use today. Thus pottery has strong link to civilization."
81,Infiltration simulator,"A water infiltration simulator shows transparent tumbler tube feature consisting of sand, silt and clay, and a step further ahead, on spinning the wheal you can realize how different sized particles affects water movement, for example water movement is faster in sand sized particles (white color) common in desert soils and hence requires frequent irrigation when agriculture is practiced in such soils."
82,Cemented calcareou pan,"The landscapes of the United Arab Emirates are commonly underlain by lithified calcium carbonate rich layer like ""hardpan"". This is a restrictive feature to use this land for agriculture purpose. Such a hardpan can be exploited to make road beds for highways."
83,Bottlebrush gypsum,"Fiery-orange gypsum crystals surrounding the branches of zygophyllum bush. It was found in Al Samaliya Island of Abu Dhabi emirate, where the entire zygophyllum community was invaded by water rich in calcium and sulfates resulting into full invasion of zygophyllum community."
84,Loose sand with gypsum,The sand rich in gypsum crystals of various sizes is the starting point to form desert rose under desert hot desert conditions.
85,Gypsum rose - initial stage,The loose gypsum crystals in soil are dissolved and recrystallized into a rough surface desert rose including sand particles.
86,Gypsum rose - final stage,Over time the rough surface sandy-gypsum desert rose is further crystallized into sharp petals similar to rose flower thus called desert rose.
